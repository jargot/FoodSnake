# Food Snake

A quick and dirty python script to parse The Flavor Bible and convert it's ingredients as Anki flashcards.

PRs welcome.


**FIXME**:
* Some ingredient pairings are incomplete
* "Double headings" are not parsed correctly

**TODO:**
* Parse general info (Season, Weight, Volume, Technique)
* Parse flavor affinities
* Parse The Vegetarian Bible (if it has more info...)

**Similar works:**
* Alexander Reeves' webbing app - https://github.com/areeves87/Flavor-Bible-App
